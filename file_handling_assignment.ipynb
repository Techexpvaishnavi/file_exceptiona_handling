    "## <u>Multithreading</u> :   Multithreading is a programming technique tthat assigns multiple code segments to a single process . These code segments , also referred to as threads, run concurrently and parallel to each other . These threads share the same memory space within parent process \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Multithreading :-  \n",
    "- It requires less memory storage .\n",
    "- Accessing memory is easier since threads share the same parent process.\n",
    "- Switching between  threads is fast and efficient .\n",
    "- All thread share one process memory pool and the same address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of Multithreading:-  \n",
    "- A multithreading system can not be intterrupted.\n",
    "- The code can be more challenging to understand\n",
    "- The overhead associated with managing differnt thread may be too costly for basic tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## <u> Muliprocessing </u> :  Multiprocessing refers tto a system that has more than two central processing unitts(CPUs) .Every additional CPU  added to a system increases its speed , power and memory. This allows user to run muliple processes simultaneously. \n",
    "1. Symmetric multprocessing :- This multiprocessing system uses computer hardware and software that incorporates two or more identical processors connected by one memory space.\n",
    "2. Asymmetric multiprocessing :- In this multiprocessing system , different CPUs have access to separate input and output devices .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Multiprocessing :-\n",
    "- It uss simple coding that's easy to understand.\n",
    "- It helps you overcome global interpreter lock limitations in CPython.\n",
    "- Child proccesses can be interupted\n",
    "- It completes tasks faster and analyze large amount of data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of Multiprocessing : -\n",
    "- It requires more memory storage and overhead than threads to move data between process.\n",
    "- Spawing process take longer than spawing threads .\n",
    "- An inter-process comunication model must be implemented to share objects between processes.\n",

    "1. try :: This is where you place the code that might trigger an exception . Python runs this code and keeps an eye out for any exception .\n",
    "2. except :: if an exception occurs in the try block .Python will jump to the except blockto handle the error or take the necessary steps for neccessary steps  for recovery.\n",
    "3. else :: this block runs if no exception were raised in he try block . It's handy for executing code tha should only run if the try block is successful\n",
    "4. finally :: Code within the finally block runs no matter what, whether an exception not.It's often used for clean up tasks like closing files or network connetions"
